# yt-dlp-ng Project Plan

## Overview
Modern implementation of yt-dlp with performance improvements and enhanced architecture to overcome existing limitations.

## Phase 1: Foundation (Weeks 1-2)
**Core Architecture:**
- **Rust core** with async networking (tokio)
- **Plugin system** for extractors (WebAssembly modules)
- **CLI interface** with clap for argument parsing
- **Configuration system** with TOML/YAML support

**Initial Structure:**
```

├── src/
│   ├── core/          # Core download engine
│   ├── extractors/    # Built-in extractors
│   ├── cli/           # Command-line interface
│   ├── config/        # Configuration handling
│   └── utils/         # Shared utilities
├── extractors/        # WASM extractor modules
├── tests/            # Unit and integration tests
├── docs/             # Documentation
└── packaging/        # Flatpak/Snap configs
```

## Phase 2: Core Features (Weeks 3-4)
- **Async download engine** with connection pooling
- **Basic extractors** (YouTube, common sites)
- **Metadata extraction** and caching
- **Progress reporting** and resume capability

## Phase 3: Advanced Features (Weeks 5-6)
- **Anti-detection system** with proxy rotation
- **Playlist support** and batch downloads
- **Format selection** and quality options
- **Post-processing** (ffmpeg integration)

## Phase 4: Distribution (Weeks 7-8)
- **Flatpak packaging** with freedesktop.org submission
- **Snap packaging** for Ubuntu store
- **CI/CD pipeline** for automated builds
- **Documentation** and user guides

## Technology Stack
- **Rust** (core) + **WebAssembly** (extractors)
- **Tokio** (async runtime) + **Reqwest** (HTTP client)
- **Flatpak** (primary distribution) + **Snap** (secondary)

## Key Improvements Over yt-dlp
1. **Performance**: Async-first design, concurrent downloads, lazy loading
2. **Anti-detection**: IP rotation, browser fingerprinting, adaptive patterns
3. **Distribution**: Native desktop integration via Flatpak/Snap
4. **Maintainability**: Modular architecture with hot-swappable extractors
5. **User Experience**: Better progress reporting, configuration management
